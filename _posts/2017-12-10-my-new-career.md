When I graduated from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls with a bachelors degree in journalism in 2011, I figured my life's career path was set. Having enjoyed writing in high school, I thought a career as a reporter was the best way to write stories that would impact people's lives on a daily basis.

However, when you are 22 years old, you don't also have a full idea of how the demands your career will impact your life. I spent the next five-plus years in journalism, working at community newspapers throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. During that time, I transitioned from a news reporter to covering sports. While the work was rewarding, I often worked six or seven days a week while making less money than most of my friends with college degrees. Plus, after seeing my colleagues lose their jobs due to layoffs, I wondered if someday I might be facing unemployment myself.

At the same time, I started to become fascinated with the seemingly magical process of writing software with code. After trying out coding myself through resources like Code Academy, I decided software development was a field I wanted to pursue.

I started my education at Prime Digital Academy, a coding boot camp, in August 2017. I am on track to graduate from the program in January of 2018.
While I hope to continue working as a part-time freelance journalist, I am looking forward to starting my new career as a software developer. I can't wait to see what I accomplish in the future.
