The end of my education at Prime Digital Academy is rapidly approaching. My cohort's graduation date is January 19.
One of the significant milestones in Prime's coursework is writing a group project for a client. I had the pleasure of teaming up with three of my classmates to write an application for Footprint, a startup that consults with nonprofit organizations to help reduce their environmental impact.
The application relies on a CSV upload process to give nonprofit organizations a tool to store and analyze carbon footprint data from their projects. The CSV data is converted into tons of CO2 with javascript functions and stored in a SQL database before being displayed using Chart.js.
The project was written using an AngularJS frontend, Express, Nodejs and a SQL database.
I was happy with what our group was able to accomplish in just three short weeks. The final product exceeded my expectations, and our client said he was pleased with the results.
This group project was my first opportunity to work with a client, and I enjoyed the experience.
The application is deployed on Heroku. Follow this link to check it out: [pitch aid][pitch-aid]
